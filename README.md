## Development

The project uses:

- TypeScript for type safety
- ESLint for code quality
- Tailwind for utility-first CSS
- shadcn/ui components built on Radix UI primitives
- Lucide icons
- Vercel for deployment

## Getting started (development)

Quick steps to run the project locally (tested with Bun):

1. Install Bun (if missing) and add it to your PATH:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash
export PATH="$HOME/.bun/bin:$PATH"
```

2. From the project root, install dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

3. Start the dev server (this repo's `dev` script expects a `PORT` env var):

```bash
# use the Vite default port locally
PORT=5173 bun dev
```

If your environment injects `$PORT` (for example in some cloud/CI), you can omit setting it.

Expose the dev server on the LAN:

```bash
PORT=5173 bun dev --host
# or
PORT=5173 bun dev --host 0.0.0.0
```

Troubleshooting: esbuild host vs binary mismatch
- If you see an error like: "Host version \"X\" does not match binary version \"Y\"",
  reinstall the esbuild package that matches the host version. Example:

```bash
# check host version
node -e "console.log(require('esbuild').version)"

# reinstall matching binary (example if host version is 0.25.9)
bun add esbuild@0.25.9 --dev
bun install
PORT=5173 bun dev
```

Optional helper script (add to `scripts/dev.sh`):

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
set -euo pipefail

# default port if not provided
PORT="${PORT:-5173}"
export PATH="$HOME/.bun/bin:$PATH"

bun install
PORT=$PORT bun dev
```

Make it executable: `chmod +x scripts/dev.sh` and run `./scripts/dev.sh`.
